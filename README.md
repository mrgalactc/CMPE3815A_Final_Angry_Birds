# Microcontrollers Final Project
For the Final Project in Microcontroller Systems, Jack and I attempted to create a real-life Angry Birds, which consisted of launching a bird (a projectile) at objects (the pigs) using a slingshot (a nerf blaster). All of this was controlled using an Arduino, servos, a stepper motor, and a touchpad. The functionality, uses, and code is available on this page.
