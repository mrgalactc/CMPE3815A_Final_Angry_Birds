# UVM Microcontroller Systems Final Project
For the Final Project in Microcontroller Systems, Jack and I attempted to create real-life Angry Birds. This game involved launching a bird (a projectile) at objects (the pigs) using a slingshot (a Nerf blaster). The game was controlled using an Arduino, servos, a stepper motor, and a touchpad. The functionality, assembly, and code are available on this page.

## Getting Started
### Hardware List
The required components for this project include:
-  An Arduino
-  An Adafruit TSC2007 Resistive Touch Screen and I2C Controller
-  Servos and a 3D-printed Gimbal
-  A Nerf Blaster
-  A DC Motor
-  A Battery Pack (for the DC motor)
-  A Button (for trigger actuation)

### Software List
The required components for this project include:
-  Arduino IDE (only to make changes and upload the code)
-  From the Library Manager on IDE:
   -  'Servo.h'
   -  'Adafruit_TSC2007.h'
